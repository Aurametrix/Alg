"Given a pattern and a string input - find if the string follows the same pattern and return true or false."

Examples:

Pattern : "abba", input: "redbluebluered" should return 1.
Pattern: "aaaa", input: "asdasdasdasd" should return 1.
Pattern: "aabb", input: "xyzabcxzyabc" should return 0.


Regular expressions (abbreviated as regex or regexp, with plural forms regexes, regexps, or regexen) are written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor, a program that either serves as a parser generator or examines text and identifies parts that match the provided specification.
