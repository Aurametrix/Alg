pop is great for stacks and queues; 
del of a range can delete more than one item at once; 
remove removes the first occurrence of the given item, whithout needing an index.

L=[9,4,6,3,7]
L.pop(2)
L.remove(6)
del L[2:3]

4 built-in data types in Python: Lists, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary
Hash - the most important data structure of Perl is known as dictionary in Python
In Perl there are three main data structures: scalars, arrays, and hashes. 
In Python, there are scalars, arrays and lists, and dictionaries (and many others). 
In R, there are no scalars, just vectors of length one.
hash/associative array/dictionary data structure is a hash constructor.
