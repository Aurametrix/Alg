### Tensors and Dynamic neural networks

* [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) - a deep learning framework that puts Python first
    * [OpenNMT - a full-featured, open-source neural machine translation system utilizing the Torch mathematical toolkit](https://github.com/opennmt/opennmt)

* [DyNet – Dynamic neural network library](https://github.com/clab/dynet)

TensorFlow is "Define-and-Run". Chainer, PyTorch, and DyNet are "Define-by-Run", as the graph structure is defined on-the-fly via the actual forward computation.
