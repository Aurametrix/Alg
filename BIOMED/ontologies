MedDRA is distributed as a set of 12 record-oriented ASCII files, each of which describes
one of the "levels" of the MedDRA ontology and associations among the objects in the ontology (construed as a system of terms): system and organ classes, preferred terms, low-level terms, high-level terms, and high-level group terms.
Records contain various codes linking the terms and records, and refer to other systems of classification
such as the Hoechst Adverse Reaction Terminology System (HARTS), the World Health Organization Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART), and IDC-9 (IDC-10).

the WHO Drug dictionary consists of 8 record-oriented ASCII files with information about drugs such as names and ingredients

BioWisdom protein ontology
GSK THerapy ontology (similar to WHO Drug dictionary)
Gene Ontology - 3 hierarchies

notes:
in-therapeutic-class in a GSK THesarus ontology, the subordination hierarchy in MedDRA, and the
ATC (Anatomical-Therapeutical-Chemical) and ingredients hierarches in the WHO Drug Dictionary.

Not all interesting or useful ontology relations are hierarchical 
examples: isbiologically-equivalent-to or is-interchangeable-with
is-a-competitor-of, is-marketed-in


The WHO Drug Dictionary contains data from 1968 onwards. The content is originating mostly from IMS and National 
Drug names References
