CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) 
provides a standard for organizing and formatting data to streamline processes in collection, management, analysis and reporting. 
Implementing SDTM supports data aggregation and warehousing; fosters mining and reuse; facilitates sharing; helps perform due diligence 
and other important data review activities; 
and improves the regulatory review and approval process. 
SDTM is also used in non-clinical data (SEND), medical devices and pharmacogenomics/genetics studies.
