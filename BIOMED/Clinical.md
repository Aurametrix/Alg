### MedPaLM, a large language model encoding clinical knowledge. 

MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; 

HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online

Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics),
